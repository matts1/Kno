      <h2>User manual</h2>
      <h3>Students</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account on the website by clicking the 'sign up' button</li>
        <li>Log in with the 'login' button</li>
        <li>Join a course, either by searching for the course name or by finding it in the
          courses page. If it is a private course, you will need a code in order to join it.
          Once you have it, click 'join course' in the navbar on the top</li>
        <li>You will get a notification whenever a new task comes up. Click on the link when
          it does, and you will see the task (or if you open up the course,
          you will get a link to the task)</li>
        <li>You can submit for tasks on the task page, and view your marks on the scoreboard
          page, which is accessible from the course page</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Teachers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an account on the website by clicking the 'sign up' button</li>
      <li>Log in with the 'login' button</li>
      <li>Create a course with the create > course option in the top right</li>
      <li>Create a task with the options given. You will be able to edit it as soon as you
        make it</li>
      <li>Edit the task description. You can use special syntax to show various things - math
        equations with $$math$$, \(math\), or \[math\], where math is written in latex. Code can
        be written with ```&lt;language&gt;, then your code on a new line, followed with ```. There
        is a special language called io, which allows you to do input and output - simply put a
        <<< before any input. A # at the start of the line will turn the line into a heading
        (more # = bigger heading). There is a preview window to help you if you get stuck.</li>
      <li>For programming tasks, provide a correct solution and a set of inputs,
        and the outputs of your correct solution will automatically generate the correct
        output. Once this is done, they will be automatically marked</li>
      <li>For assignment tasks, when the student submits them you will get a notification -
        simply click the link to see all the submissions by all the students. Download the
        students' submissions, then hand out the marks as deserved, click save, and the marks
        will be saved.</li>
