\subsection{User Testing}

\subsubsection{18th January}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Guy Segev said that I should make the signup and login be front and center on the first page, so I created a massive box in which there was a signup and login button.
    \item He also said that I should put a login form on the home page, but I decided that for implementation reasons, that would be a challenge to do while keeping the aesthetics of the page.
\end{itemize}
