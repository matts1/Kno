\subsection{Platform Considerations}
\paragraph{}
Due to the fact that the program I am writing is a web server, there are no changes from the user's perspective when you change the operating system you develop on. For that reason, I chose to develop on Linux, as I find it to be far superior to Windows and Mac when developing. I also chose to use google cloud to host it, with google appengine, because appengine provides most of the features of web frameworks such as django, but is relatively simple to understand, and because google has no downtime and their cloud hosting is free (although there is a limit on CPU power for free accounts).
